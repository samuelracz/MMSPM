# Multi-Modal Spectral Parametrization Method (MMSPM) for analyzing EEG activity with distinct scaling regimes

## This software is still in development.

The purpose of MMSPM is to characterize the power spectra of brain electrophysiological recordings (such as EEG or ECoG) by deconstructing it into broadband aperiodic and narrow-band oscillatory components. In this MMSPM framework, the broadband component is modeled as a composite of two power-law fucntions with independent scaling regimes separated by a breakpoint frequency _f<sub>bp</sub>_.
